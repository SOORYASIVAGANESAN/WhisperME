# WhisperME

Hello I am Soorya Sivaganesan. I am a freshman at NYU Stern School of Business. During my summer break, I came up with an idea of developing an annonymous messager where friends can send messages to their friends anonymously. 

It was a fun project and it gained traction during the first few weeks through word-of-mouth. I have given a jist of the code, you can take a look at it. 
Ciao
